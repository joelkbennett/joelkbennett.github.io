I am a Full Stack Web Developer and experienced Graphic Designer with a passion for building online experiences and
learning new technologies. My prior work and education has built a unique foundation of strong technical and creative
visual design expertise, making me a capable, flexible and ideal candidate.

I am extremely well versed in modern web development, with a love of full-stack JavaScript and strong foundations in Ruby,
PHP, and Python. On the front-end, I have years of experience with CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Bourbon, and
regularly utilize technologies such as SASS, Gulp, and Webpack. Git is the center of my workflow, and I am able to quickly
jump into new projects and contribute.

As a Graphic Designer working for both print and web, I bring a wealth of experience to front-end design, encompassing
grid theory and layout design, typography and color. I have well over 10 years of experience with Adobe Photoshop,
Illustrator and InDesign.

Oh, by the way, I'm currently a Front-End Developer at The Coup Company, where we work for clients such as CBC, Telus, Telus Fund, VIFF, Canada Games, Wattpad, The Radcliffe Foundation, and more!
