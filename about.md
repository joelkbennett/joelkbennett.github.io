subtitle: Joel Bennett is a Web Developer &amp; Graphic Designer based in Vancouver, BC
---

I am a junior full-stack web developer who combines strong technical skills with a life-long love of visual design and communication. I have a wide range of experience over many years encompassing web design, development and graphic design. I'm a creative problem solver who loves the process of digital design, though my trusty analog notebook is always bursting with ideas, explorations and illustrations.
