I've been volunteering at the Vancouver Tool Library for almost 4 months now, which means you'll find me sitting behind the counter every second Sunday from 10 til 3. Coming in off the street, you might be tempted to ask me for advice or an opinion on your current/next project. You will probably be disappointed, because I know almost nothing about cutting, chopping, nailing, screwing, building, glueing, or sanding. Generally speaking, I don't know how the hell things are built.

This is essentially why I decided to volunteer. I've been a member for a good number of years (with a nice and low member number to prove it), but I haven't really done anything with it. I maintain my bikes... maybe a couple of times a years I need something cut or bend or whatevered for my brewing setup, but otherwise, I've been slow to get projects rolling. Not that I haven't had ideas.

For example: I want to build a shelf. I've had a huge (HUGE) plastic barrel in my backyard for years that I've been wanting to turn into a spinning composter. I'd love to construct a stand for my grain mill. Hell, I'm using an old door for a desk, which might sound cool and rustic, but it's just not. It sucks. I should build a new desk!

There are things to be made, and becoming a volunteer was supposed to help open myself to the domain of tools. After four month, it finally happened. I built something.

Library as Interface
--------------------

Sitting on the ground under a row of handing long-handles lawn and garden tools used to be an old coffee can. It was stuffed full of hand clippers or cutters or whatever you'd call them (tool ignorance right on time), and it was a mess. Noticing them was hard enough as it, and sorting through them was a pain. In terms of a member walking looking for such a tool, discoverability was very low. This is something the library has gotten much better at in the last year, with the addition of a brilliant hanging system, better shelf organization and labeling. Not everything has found it's place yet.

Some tools are just prone to piling, so the problem is, who do we increase discoverability? The inverse is also true: how do you immediately communicate that a particular tool is NOT currently available, if it's already out on loan?

This is what I was tasked with, one Sunday morning. My solution was pretty simple. I build a box that could interface with our hanging mounts.

Now, you might look at that (kinda ugly) box and wonder who could possibly be proud of that? Well, I'll tell you, conceptualizing and contructing a non-ditigal component
