<span class='caps'>I stumbled on</span> a really old Flickr account of mine yesterday when I forgot I don't use my standard "joelkbennett" on there anymore. I don't specifically recall why I opened a new account, although I believe it coincided with my last DSLR purchase, and possibly a move away from Google Photos. The point is, I was brought back to a time when film still ruled my photographic workflow.

This wasn't very active account, but what I did (re)discover were some shots from my first trip to Eastern Europe from about 10 years back. At the time I traveled with two SLRs, a bunch of lenses and a bag full of Ilford 400 black and white film. Months earlier I had setup my first darkroom in the basement of my girlfriends apartment in Halifax, though my real education in processing and printing photos came after the Europe trip in what was the former coal-room turned darkroom of my parents Cape Breton home.

The shots below were scanned with a negative scanner, and are definitely of a moodier aesthetic then I would shoot for today. I'll have to dig out those sheets of negatives someday and take another look.

I remember being pretty overwhelmed with the amount of film I came back with after three months abroad. I'm just guessing, but I had something like 500+ photos. I still have yet to process all of my photos from my Poland/Morocco/Spain trip this past summer, which might have something to do with the fact I took 2000+ photos over two and a half weeks. I've become a digital monster.

This final shot is from shortly after my return to Canada (and my move to Vancouver). I believe I got my first digital camera shortly after this was taken, so it's probably one of the last photos I took on actual film.
