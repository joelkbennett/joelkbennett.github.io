<span class='caps'>I just happened</span> to see a youtube video with a particular image I felt the need to draw earlier today. The color and tone had a very Hotline Miami vibe, so instead of doing something more productive I fired up photoshop and got to work. Above, of course, is the unfinished but final piece. Super quick, and, as far as I'm concerned, not a bad way to start the day. A little creativity before coding never hurt anyone.

I got to looking though a folder of other similarly produced digital paintings and figured, since I have no intention of revisiting any of them, I'd make use of them here.

So here they are.

From my 'Porter the dog' period, apparently.

I used to have a Lego Millennium Falcon on my desk.

And here's where I get creepy again.

Nothing too substantial but it feels good to have a place to put less serious stuff I tend to do. I'll probably follow this up with a look at some older stuff.
