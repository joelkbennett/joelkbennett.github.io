<span class='caps'>I told myself</span> I wasn't going to draw all over this notebook. This one's for words, and words only, I thought. Not that I dislike doodling in the margins; it's just that I tend to let things go too far.

I did have a good run. Made it all the way to page 66. All it took was a lecture at Lighthouse that went a bit off the rails, and now I've got another sketchbook.

Here's some bad phone photos of what happens between coding at Lighthouse Labs. It get's a bit weird.
