title: "I Bet You'll Screw Up!"
subtitle: '<span class="caps">I Bet You Screw Up</span> (IBYSU) is a promise-keeping/bet-making app in which users can make promises which other users can bet on. Users have the ability to create an account, make promises, bet on promises, and follow other users. When a promise a user has bet on has been validated or expires, the user receives a notification and loses or gains the appropriate amount of points. Users each have a ranking which depends on how many promises they have kept and how many promises they have broken. This ranking determines the number of points a user can win when betting on that users promise.'
